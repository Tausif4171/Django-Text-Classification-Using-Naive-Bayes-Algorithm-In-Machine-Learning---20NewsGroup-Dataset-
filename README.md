😃‍‍ ‍‍Django-Text-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-In-Machine-Learning-(20NewsGroup-Dataset) 😃‍

This is Machine Learning based project. Text based classification using Python we are using
naive bayes classifier approach we are actually categorizing it whether it belongs to which category based
on 20 Newsgroup Dataset. And also to show the final text classifies result we have built the frontend part
in the Django framework.

Packages used here are:
1. sklearn
2. Tfidf Vectorizer
3. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
4. Pipeline
5. Metrics

⮚ Technology used- Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstarap4.

⮚ Toolused- Visual Studio Code
